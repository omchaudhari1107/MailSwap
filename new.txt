     // const aiPrompt = `${user.name || 'User'} wants to generate a ${selectedLength.toLowerCase()} ${selectedTone.toLowerCase()} email with only the subject and main content, ensuring proper greetings and closing based on the context.  

      // For **professional emails**, use formal greetings like "Respected Sir/Madam" and closings like "Yours sincerely" or "Yours faithfully" in English, or their culturally appropriate equivalents in the specified language (e.g., "પ્રિય સાહેબ/મેડમ" and "આપની નિષ્ઠાપૂર્વક" in Gujarati).  
      // For **casual emails**, use informal greetings like "Dear friend" or "Sir" and closings like "Yours truly" or "Lovingly" in English, or their equivalents in the specified language (e.g., "પ્રિય મિત્ર" and "પ્રેમથી" in Gujarati).  
      // After the closing phrase (e.g., "Yours sincerely" or its equivalent), add a new line and include the name as follows:  
      // - If the prompt contains a phrase like "my name as [name]" or "my name is [name]" or "i am [name]" or "myself [name]" or "use my name [name]" (e.g., "my name as John"), use that specified name.  
      // - If no name is specified in the prompt, use **${user.name}** as the default name. If **${user.name}** is undefined or empty, fall back to "User".  
      // Ensure the name appears only once, after the closing phrase.  

      // **Language Instruction (Critical)**: If the prompt contains a phrase like "in [language]" (e.g., "in Gujarati"), generate the entire email—subject, greeting, body, closing, and regards—in that language. Translate all components accurately and naturally to match the specified tone. If no language is specified, default to English. Do not mix languages unless explicitly requested.  

      // Format the response as follows without enclosing the subject or content in quotes:  
      // Subject: [subject line in the specified language]  
      
      // [main content with appropriate line breaks if needed]  
      // [Proper greeting at the start with \n in the specified language]  
      // [Email body in the specified language]  
      // [Proper closing as per the tone in the specified language, followed by \n [specified name from prompt if provided, else ${user.name} or 'User' if undefined]]  
      
      // Email context: "${prompt} and ensure the email ends with proper regards in the specified language."`;
